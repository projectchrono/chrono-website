	<a class="media-left" href="http://projectchrono.org/pychrono"> <img src="../pychrono/logo_pychrono.svg" alt="PYCHRONO" style="height:40px"> </a>
	<div class="media-body">
	The new Python wrapper for Chrono is called <a href="http://projectchrono.org/pychrono">PyChrono</a>

	The PyChrono library replaces the old Chrono::PyEngine library. 

	The most relevant feature is that PyChrono is available as a precompiled Anaconda package. This means that an
	automated nightly build system will continuosly build the most recent C++ library, it will generate the Python 
	wrapper, then it will upload it onto the pychrono channell of Anaconda cloud. This happens for Windows and Linux 
	platforms, for Python 3.5 or 3.6 or 3.7, etc. Automatically. The installation on your system is managed by Anaconda,
	that also takes care of all dependencies.
	
	After the installation, you can import different modules of PyChrono, such as pychrono.postprocess, pychrono.irrlicht, 
	pychrono.fea, pychrono.mkl, etc.

	Thanks to the cloud technology, no installation is needed – sign up and build a MBS model in your browser, download and save it.
	It work from anywhere – all you need is internet connection and a browser.
    In future you’ll be able to perform scalable calculations in the cloud.

	They kindly released their code for the serialization and parsing of the models at:

The Bullet library features advanced and robust algorithms for fast collision detection.
	NOTE 1: in Chrono::Engine, only the collision detection features of the Bullet library are used, since we use the Chrono::Egine custom methods for all the rest (physics, etc.).
	NOTE 2: since the Bullet library is embedded in the Chrono::Engine library, you do not need to download and install Bullet -- it is completely wrapped inside Chrono::Engine, and you do not need to know anything about it (just keep on using the same C++ functions that you used with the previous releases).

It fixes some compatibility issues with the latest Irrlicht 1.3.1 libraries. The previous Chrono::Engine SDK was compatible only with Irrlicht 1.3. From this release, we support Irrlicht v1.3.1 or superior. Note that the Irrlicht library is needed only for compiling the demos with 3D realtime views. NOTE!!! this 0.1.9 release replaces the 0.1.8 of two days ago, because we updated the installer and the makefiles, so it can be installed also in paths containing spaces, ex: "C:\\Program files\\chronoengine".

The free and powerful Irrlicht library offers a clean and easy-to-use C++ API, it is platform independent and uses either OpenGL or DirectX, so we adopted it as the default way of showing Chrono::Engine simulations in realtime 3D views.
	Note that other 3D engines can be used as well, such as OGRE or DirectX, but the source code for examples provided in Chrono::Engine will use Irrlicht.
	To allow rapid developement of application based on Chrono::Engine + Irrlicht, we provide also some utility C++ classes.
